## 🚨 Identified Issues & Impact Assessment

### Minor Data Structure Mismatches
**Severity:** LOW  
**Count:** 3 endpoints affected

1. **Medicine `is_prescription` field missing**
   - Workaround: Use `requires_prescription` field
   - Fix: Add field mapping or update TypeScript interface

2. **Supplement product classification**
   - Workaround: Default to non-prescription products
   - Fix: Add missing fields to API response

3. **Medical Device categorization**
   - Impact: May affect advanced filtering features
   - Fix: Enhance API response with classification fields

### Stock Data Availability
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Stock information available but not consistently populated

- Current: 0/11 medicines have explicit stock data
- Workaround: Use inventory-records endpoint for stock information
- Recommendation: Integrate stock data into product responses

---

## 📋 Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **✅ No Critical Issues Found** - All systems operational

### Medium Priority  
2. **Enhance Product Type Fields**
   - Add missing `product_type` to supplements and medical devices
   - Standardize `device_type` and `device_class` fields
   - **Timeline:** Next API update cycle

3. **Improve Stock Data Integration**  
   - Include stock information in product responses
   - **Benefit:** Reduces API calls for dashboard operations

### Low Priority
4. **TypeScript Interface Updates**
   - Align interfaces with actual API responses
   - Add optional fields for backward compatibility
   - **Timeline:** Next frontend maintenance cycle

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider response caching for slower endpoints (>400ms)
   - **Target:** `/inventory-records/` and `/orders/` endpoints

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Response Time Analysis
- **Fast (< 150ms):** 14 endpoints (48%)
- **Moderate (150-300ms):** 13 endpoints (45%) 
- **Slow (> 300ms):** 2 endpoints (7%)

**Slowest Endpoints:**
- `/inventory-records/`: 465ms
- `/orders/`: 466ms  

**Recommendation:** These are acceptable for current load but monitor under higher traffic.
