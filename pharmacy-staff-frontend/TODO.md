- ✅ **Schema Alignment**: Ensure validation schemas match real API contracts exactly
- ✅ **Form Component Creation**: Build `[Entity]Form.tsx` following Phase 1-5 pattern with FormProvider context
- ✅ **Page Integration**: Replace unvalidated forms in `app/[entity]/page.tsx` with validated form component
- ✅ **Create operation works** with validation in actual page UI
- ✅ **Edit operation works** with validation in actual page UI
- ✅ **Delete operation unaffected** by validation changes
- ✅ **All existing functionality preserved** - no breaking changes to user workflows
- ✅ **Error messages display correctly** in integrated form UI
- ✅ **Form submission prevents invalid data** before reaching API
- ✅ **API integration remains intact** with proper data transformation
- ✅ **Live API Testing**: Test actual API calls with corrected field names through the UI
- ✅ **FormProvider context working**: No "Cannot destructure property 'getFieldState'" errors
- ✅ **No console errors or warnings** when using forms in browser
- ✅ **Linting passes** on all validation and form files
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation succeeds** with proper type inference

## Risk Mitigation
- Work on feature branches for each phase
- Test each entity thoroughly before moving to next
- Keep existing forms as fallback during development
- Incremental rollout with immediate rollback capability

## 🎯 **KEY REQUIREMENT FOR PHASES 6-9**

**Every phase MUST include both:**

### 1. **Form Component Creation** 
- Build `[Entity]Form.tsx` following the **exact same pattern** as CustomerForm, ProductForm, StaffForm, BranchForm
- Use `zodResolver` from `@/lib/forms` (NOT from @hookform/resolvers directly)
- Use `<Form {...form}>` wrapper to provide FormProvider context
- Import form fields from `@/components/forms`
- Follow established interface pattern: `{ entity, onSubmit, onCancel, isSubmitting }`

### 2. **Page Integration**
- Replace unvalidated forms in existing `app/[entity]/page.tsx` files
- Integrate the new validated form component into existing dialogs/UI
- Test the form works in the actual page context (not just in isolation)
- Ensure no "Cannot destructure property 'getFieldState'" errors
- Verify all existing functionality continues to work

### 3. **Success Criteria**
- ✅ Build passes without errors
- ✅ Linting passes without warnings  
- ✅ Forms work in browser without console errors
- ✅ Real-time validation works in the UI
- ✅ API integration works through the validated forms
- ✅ No regressions in existing page functionality

**If any phase skips form integration into actual pages, it is INCOMPLETE!** 🚨
